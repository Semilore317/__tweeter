# Use semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility and SEO.
Why settle for a plain <div> when a <section> sings with purpose? Semantic tags like <article>, <nav>, or <aside> whisper meaning to screen readers and search engines alike, lifting both accessibility and discoverability. How do you decide when a tag carries enough intent?

# Always include alt attributes for images.
A picture may paint a thousand words, but without alt text, it’s mute to some. Craft it with care—“A golden retriever bounds through a sunlit field”—and sidestep vague nothings like “dog pic.” What story does your alt text tell?

# Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts.
Flexbox flows like a river, guiding elements in a single direction, while Grid carves a canvas for two-dimensional mastery. Imagine a photo gallery—Grid aligns it effortlessly. Which do you reach for when the layout whispers “adapt”?

!Important is a sledgehammer—effective, but it shatters specificity’s delicate dance. Save it for dire moments, like taming third-party styles. How often do you resist its blunt allure?

# Use relative units like rem and em for better scalability.
Pixels pin you down, but rem and em breathe with the design. Rem roots itself in the document’s font-size, em in its parent’s embrace—scalable elegance. How do you choose between them in a nested world?

# Keep your CSS modular and well-organized.
A sprawling stylesheet is a labyrinth; instead, carve paths—/styles/buttons.css, /styles/forms.css. It’s a garden, not a jungle. How do you tame your styles without losing their soul?

Inline styles are a quick sketch, not a masterpiece—lacking media queries, uncacheable. Reach for CSS instead, but when does convenience trump elegance?

# Apply mobile-first design principles.
Begin with the small screen’s humility, then bloom outward with min-width queries. It’s a foundation, not an afterthought. Why does starting small feel so liberating?

# Make use of media queries for responsive design.
Media queries are your brushstrokes—paint a layout that bends at 768px or stretches at 1200px. Do you cluster them by component or let them flow free?

# Use ARIA roles to enhance accessibility where needed.
A <div> masquerading as a button needs a voice—role="button" speaks for it. But when does native HTML already carry the tune?

Virtualization paints only what’s seen—10,000 rows, no sweat. How do you keep the scroll silky?

# Avoid large bundle sizes in SPAs.
A lean bundle—200KB gzipped—flies. A bloated one lags. How do you pare your React app to its essence?

# Test your site on low-end devices and slow networks.
Throttle to 3G, shrink to an old phone—does it still sing? What’s the humblest device you’ve tamed?

# Avoid using alerts, confirms, and prompts for UI.
Alerts halt the dance—modals sway instead. How do you soften a harsh interruption?

# Implement meaningful error messages.
“Connection lost—try again” soothes; “Error 500” stings. How do you craft comfort in failure?

A PR under 300 lines invites keen eyes—quality over haste. How do you nurture a team’s critique?

# Make good use of browser caching.
ETags and Cache-Control cradle assets—static files linger. How long do you let them rest?

A 404 guides, not scolds—links home, a dash of wit. How do you keep it true to your voice?
